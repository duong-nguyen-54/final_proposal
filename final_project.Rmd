##### Low Birthweight Data 
```{r}

##### Health Indicator Dataset 
The following dataset is obtained from New York State Department of Health (https://www.health.ny.gov/) that contains 4 different health indicators that will complement with the low birthweight. These 5 will act as our outcomes of interest for our regression models.

```{r}
health <- health %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  select (geographic_area,indicator_title,topic_area,rate_percent,measurement) %>%
  filter( str_detect (geographic_area, " County")) %>% 
  mutate (county = str_replace (geographic_area, " County", "")) %>%
  select (county, everything()) %>%
  select (-geographic_area) %>%
  filter(topic_area == "Cancer Indicators" | topic_area == "Respiratory Disease Indicators" | topic_area == "Cardiovascular Disease Indicators" | topic_area == "Maternal and Infant Health Indicators")
  
cancer <- health %>% 
  filter (topic_area == "Cancer Indicators") %>% 
  filter (indicator_title == "All cancer incidence rate per 100,000") %>% 
  select (-c(indicator_title, topic_area, measurement)) %>% 
  rename (cancer_mortality_per_100k = "rate_percent")

resp <- health %>%
  filter (topic_area == "Respiratory Disease Indicators") %>%
  filter (indicator_title == "Asthma hospitalization rate per 10,000") %>% 
  select (-c(indicator_title, topic_area, measurement)) %>% 
  rename (asthma_hosp_rate_per_10k = "rate_percent")

cardio <- health %>%
  filter (topic_area == "Cardiovascular Disease Indicators") %>%
  filter (indicator_title == "Cardiovascular disease hospitalization rate per 10,000") %>% 
  select (-c(indicator_title, topic_area, measurement)) %>% 
  rename (cardio_hosp_rate_per_10k = "rate_percent")

maternal <- health %>%
  filter (topic_area == "Maternal and Infant Health Indicators") %>%
  filter (indicator_title == "Percentage of premature births with <37 weeks gestation") %>% 
  select (-c(indicator_title, topic_area, measurement)) %>% 
  rename (premature_percentage = "rate_percent")

```
They are:   
  - `cancer_mortality_per_100k`: percentage of cancer mortality per 100 thousands people in each NY county (Cancer Indicator)    
  - `asthma_hosp_rate_per_10k`: percentage of asthma hospitalization per 10 thousands people in each NY county (Respiratory Disease Indicator)     
  - `cardio_hosp_rate_per_10k`": percentage of cardiovascular-disease-related hospitalization per 10 thousands people in each NY county (Cardiovascular Disease Indicator)   
  - `premature_percentage`: percentage of children being born prematurely (<37  gestational weeks) in each NY county

##### Merge dataset:
Here we perform `inner_join()` to create 2 bigger datasets `health_merge` and `demographic_merge`. Then, we join them with our `lowbirthweight` & `pm2_5` tp make a finalized data frame called `merge`. And, we will use this for regression model. 
```{r}
health_merge <- maternal %>% 
  inner_join(cancer, by = "county") %>%
  inner_join(resp, by = "county") %>% 
  inner_join(cardio, by = "county") 

demographic_merge <- age %>%
  inner_join(sex,  by = "county") %>%
  inner_join(income, by = "county") %>% 
  inner_join(race_merge, by = "county") %>% 
  inner_join(edu, by = "county") %>%
  mutate(county = str_replace (county, "St ", "St. "))
  

merge <- lowbirthweight %>% 
  inner_join(pm2_5, by = "county") %>%
  inner_join(health_merge, by = "county") %>% 
  inner_join(demographic_merge, by = "county") 

merge <- merge %>% 
  select (county, annual_pm2.5,everything())%>%
  mutate(asthma_hosp_rate_per_10k = as.numeric(asthma_hosp_rate_per_10k))%>%
  mutate(cardio_hosp_rate_per_10k = as.numeric(cardio_hosp_rate_per_10k)) %>%
  mutate(premature_percentage = as.numeric(premature_percentage))%>%
  mutate(cancer_mortality_per_100k = as.numeric(cancer_mortality_per_100k))

```

##### Making Map File
```{r}
uscounties <- uscounties %>% 
  filter (state_id == "NY") %>%
  select (county, lat, lng)

map <- merge %>% 
  inner_join(uscounties, by ="county")

write.csv(map, "NY_map.csv", row.names = FALSE)
